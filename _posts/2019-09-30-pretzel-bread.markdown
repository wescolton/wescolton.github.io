# Pretzel Bread

Have you ever had it? Pretzel bread? It starts out with promise and excitement. And eventually? You are left with only disappointment.

Example:
1. The crust is **too** crunchy
2. The inside is **too** tall
3. The whole thing overwhelms any sad meats that happen to sit on it.

That's it!
That's the post!

> the only thing necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to eat pretzel bread.
